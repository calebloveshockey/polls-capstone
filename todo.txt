- copy all builtin vercel styling to my app
- review existing pages
- Add the cool hover effect for the bottom links on OG app to the nav links on main app
- make a dynamic nav link that checks if logged in and makes it "Account" and "Logout", otherwise it makes it "Login"
- make default starting page just show "Loading..." and redirect to home page
- Add feedback to login page
- redo .env to match with vercel to make things easier
- eventually need to look at protecting the server actions more, as apparently they are exposed API endpoints
- some sort of explanation of each poll type when creating a poll
- eventually make the endDate picker be much better: especially need to add time not just date. I visualize a slider that can give you two different types of pickers, one for "pick a date and time", and one that is "how long do you want this poll to run"
- eventually should add option descriptions
- usernames should not be case sensitive
- eventually fix how I have two exports on each component page, need to figure out which way is better and standardize
- eventually standardize server action responses
- add error checking for the "End Date" when creating a poll (should not be able to create a poll with an expiry date that is already expired)
- definitely need to standardize the server action responses
- privacy settings for polls 
- way to know what the user voted for, and highlight that option in the poll
- make results page live using polling or sockets
- if the user sends empty options they forgot to delete when creating a new poll, these should just be ignored, I can see this being a common "user error".
- Change the TradVoter etc. and TradResults etc, styling to use sheets since they share a lot of styling
- Probably should order the results on the poll page
- implement a non-account based cookie user tracking
- make sure all colors are unique in the bar graphs
- after creating account, find way to send user back to login page and have it display a success message. Need to figure out how to use the router to add #$vars or whatever they are in the URL, and how to access them from the URL in the component.
- add code to create default admin account in dbinitializer
