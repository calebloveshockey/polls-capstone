- copy all builtin vercel styling to my app
- review existing pages
- Add the cool hover effect for the bottom links on OG app to the nav links on main app
- Add feedback to login page
- redo .env to match with vercel to make things easier
- eventually need to look at protecting the server actions more, as apparently they are exposed API endpoints
- eventually make the endDate picker be much better: especially need to add time not just date. I visualize a slider that can give you two different types of pickers, one for "pick a date and time", and one that is "how long do you want this poll to run"
- eventually should add option descriptions
- eventually fix how I have two exports on each component page, need to figure out which way is better and standardize
- eventually standardize server action responses
- definitely need to standardize the server action responses
- privacy settings for polls 
- way to know what the user voted for, and highlight that option in the poll
- make results page live using polling or sockets
- Change the TradVoter etc. and TradResults etc, styling to use sheets since they share a lot of styling
- Probably should order the results on the poll page
- after creating account, find way to send user back to login page and have it display a success message. Need to figure out how to use the router to add #$vars or whatever they are in the URL, and how to access them from the URL in the component.
- look into adding secure and samesite to cookie key
- block users from voting twice
- poll voting page needs to check if poll is still open
- add time picker to the date picker for creating polls
- set up eslint for the project: especially the one that automatically cleans up import statements
- eventually add suspense boundaries for dynamic and smooth loading
- add question text to top of results


Priority:
- On a ranked poll, make user have ability to go down from 1 to 0, which will then make it null (right now you can't click the arrows to make it go to zero, you have to manually backspace)
- On a ranked poll, have the options change render order after user enters a number (put them in that ranked order) 
- On the results page, make sure the result bars have a set height, not just based off their row's height, because if an option takes up multiple rows, the voting bar takes up twice the height
- try adding a border around the results on the results page see if it makes it look good
- Change the "Share the poll" thing to be much better. I think best would be a button that has an icon on it, and when clicked it shows an animation confirming you copied it
- make navbar have stylized responsive behavior
- add to database script a creation of an admin account
- Make sure admin account management page works correctly. 
- On Account Management page, allow user to remove their account
- Add Users page that admin can look at all users and search/sort
- On users page, admin can click to visit a user's account page and can delete their account.
- Add polls page that any account can view: shows their list of polls
- When the user that created a poll is on the poll page, show a button that will take them to an edit-poll page
- Edit poll page: Change title/description text, or delete the poll altogether
- Admin can access the edit poll page of any poll
- Admin version of Polls page shows all polls on the samesite
- Add admin summary page: Shows number of users, and number of polls created, and number of votes counted
- Add Question mark icon on create-poll page that explains how each poll type works
- Add Question mark icon on poll pages next to a "Type: Ranked" etc. that will explain how the poll system works
- Change the colors of the voting bars on results page
- need to test and style for mobile, since technically that would be the primary audience
- make sure the close date field is not necessary in order to create a poll
- Add a back button on voting results page
- usernames should not be case sensitive
- add error checking for the "End Date" when creating a poll (should not be able to create a poll with an expiry date that is already expired)
- if the user sends empty options they forgot to delete when creating a new poll, these should just be ignored, I can see this being a common "user error".
- redirect users from My Account page if they don't actually have a user account.
- My Account page font sizes don't match up
- handle edge case of viewing poll results with no votes
- add error checking if any options are identical when creating a poll (should not be allowed)
- fix scrolling of background -- on pages that extend the page lower, the cool background transition shows the border.
- Add automatic refresh every 5 seconds to results page to pull results data again
- Add replies to the comment section
- make "Login" in "Login to join the discussion be a link to the login page
